Refresh the page and try again.  
If it persists, take a screenshot and email [support@goalverse.app](mailto:support@goalverse.app).

### I upgraded but still see “FREE.”
Log out or clear cookies, then **LOGIN** with the checkout email to get a fresh magic link.

For security reasons, we only send magic links to emails that exist in our system (paid users, testers, admins).  
Unknown emails won’t receive a message.
