## 2) What data we process

### 2.1 Free tier (no sign-up)

- **Local only:** Goals, chats, and usage counters are stored **locally in your browser**. We do **not** receive or store this content server-side.

### 2.2 Premium accounts

- **Account & subscription:** Email, subscription status/plan, and limited profile attributes needed to operate your account.  
- **Product data:** Goal/session metadata, dashboard metrics, and notification preferences.  
- **Operational events:** Minimal events (e.g., “checkout created”, “subscription activated”, “login”).  
- **Payments:** Processed by our provider / Merchant-of-Record; we receive **no full card details** — only references (e.g., customer/subscription IDs) and status.
