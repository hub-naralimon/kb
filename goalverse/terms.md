## 3) What GOALVERSE is

GOALVERSE is an AI-powered goal-coaching web application that provides conversational guidance, structured planning, and progress tracking.

- **Free tier (no sign-up):** Start coaching sessions anonymously; your data is stored locally in your browser only (no cloud, no sync).  
- **Premium (subscription):** Cloud storage & cross-device sync, User Dashboard with analytics, progress charts & insights, data export (CSV/JSON/PDF), and smart email notifications.

---

## 4) Access & authentication

**4.1 Anonymous free access**  
Free-tier data (goals, chats, usage counters) is stored only in your browser. Clearing browser data or switching device/browser removes that data and it cannot be recovered.

**4.2 Email sign-in (Premium)**  
Premium access uses passwordless magic-link sign-in. You are responsible for securing your email account and devices. Anyone with access to your inbox can use your magic links.

**4.3 Eligibility & responsibility**  
You confirm you are at least 18 (or have verifiable parental consent). You are responsible for all activity under your account and for keeping access secure.

## 5) Acceptable use

You must not:  
- Violate laws  
- Harass, harm, or exploit others  
- Post illegal or harmful content  
- Attempt unauthorised access  
- Bypass security or usage limits  
- Scrape, resell, or build a competing service from our content/models  
- Reverse-engineer except where permitted by law  

We may apply reasonable technical safeguards (e.g., rate limits) to preserve service quality and platform stability.

## 6) Service tiers & limits

## 7) Emails & notifications

We send transactional emails such as magic links, security notices, and (for Premium) optional progress notifications (weekly summaries, celebrations, inactivity prompts). We do not send marketing emails without your explicit opt-in. Premium users can manage notification preferences in the Dashboard.

---

## 8) Privacy & data protection

We comply with **UK GDPR** and **EU GDPR**. See our [Privacy Policy](privacy.html) for full details (data rights, purposes, legal bases, retention, international transfers, cookies).

## 9) Payments, subscriptions & billing

**9.1 Plans & prices**  
Monthly $6; Annual $60 (17% saving vs monthly). Prices may be shown/charged in local currency where supported.

**9.2 Merchant of Record (MoR)**  
Payments and invoicing are handled by **Lemon Squeezy** (our Merchant of Record). Taxes (e.g., VAT) may be calculated and collected by Lemon Squeezy in accordance with applicable law. Your purchase is additionally governed by [Lemon Squeezy Buyer Terms](https://lemonsqueezy.com/buyer-terms).

**9.3 Cooling-off & refunds**  
See our [Refund & Cancellation Policy](refund.html) and the Lemon Squeezy Buyer Terms. You authorise recurring charges for subscriptions until you cancel.

**9.4 Price changes**  
We may change prices with at least 30 days’ notice to active subscribers. Changes apply on the next renewal unless you cancel beforehand.

**9.5 Manage billing**  
Use **Dashboard → Manage Billing** to update payment methods, switch plans, or cancel (this opens the Lemon Squeezy customer portal). Cancelling stops future renewals; access typically continues until the end of the paid period.

## 11) Disclaimers

The Service is provided **“as is”** and **“as available.”** Availability and accuracy are not guaranteed. GOALVERSE provides informational/motivational support and does not replace professional medical, therapeutic, legal, or financial advice. Use your own judgement and seek qualified professionals where appropriate.

## 12) Liability limit

To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages. Our total aggregate liability for any claim relating to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid in the preceding 12 months (or £0 for free users).

## 13) Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your breach of these Terms or misuse of the Service.

## 14) Termination

You may delete your Premium account via the Dashboard (server-stored data will be erased per the Privacy Policy), or simply stop using the Service if you are on the free tier. We may suspend or terminate access for breach, abuse, non-payment, or risk to the platform. Upon termination, access ceases, future renewals stop, and data is handled per our Privacy Policy. Provisions that logically survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, liability) shall survive.

## 15) Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms. Material changes will be notified at least 30 days in advance (email or in-app notice). Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
