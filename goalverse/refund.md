# Refund & Cancellation Policy — GOALVERSE

**Last updated:** 30 October 2025

---

## 1) Merchant of Record (MoR)

GOALVERSE uses **Lemon Squeezy** as our Merchant of Record. All payments, invoicing, taxes, and buyer protections are handled by Lemon Squeezy under their [Buyer Terms](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/buyer-terms).  
Where this policy and the Buyer Terms differ, the **Lemon Squeezy Buyer Terms prevail**.

---

## 2) Plans & billing cycles

- **Monthly:** $6 billed every month  
- **Annual:** $60 billed every 12 months (equivalent to $5/month)

Prices are shown in **USD** unless otherwise stated. Any taxes (e.g., VAT) are calculated and collected by Lemon Squeezy at checkout.

---

## 3) Cooling-off period (UK/EU consumers)

- UK/EU consumers purchasing online may have a **14-day cancellation right** under consumer law.  
- Goalverse is a **digital service** that begins immediately **if you consent** (by purchasing a monthly or yearly plan). In that case, the statutory right may be **lost**.  
- After your purchase, you’ll receive an email from **Lemon Squeezy – Sienda Ltd** (via `hello@lemonsqueezy-mail.com`). This email contains:
  - Your order confirmation  
  - Links to view your order and manage your subscription  
  - Invoice download  
  - Legal terms  
  - Support contact information  
- **No cooling-off period applies** to renewals or repeat purchases unless required by law.

---

## 4) How to cancel

You can cancel at any time via the **Manage Billing** portal (Lemon Squeezy customer portal).  
- Cancellation **stops future renewals**  
- Your Premium features remain available **until the end of the current paid period**, unless a refund is processed under §3

> 🔍 If you can’t find your portal link, use the **“View my order / Manage Subscription”** link in your Lemon Squeezy receipt, or contact us at [support@goalverse.app](mailto:support@goalverse.app) and we’ll re-send it.

---

## 5) Refunds outside the cooling-off period

Outside §3, refunds are **generally not provided** for time already used. We may grant a refund **at our discretion** for:

- Duplicate charges or accidental double billing  
- Proven technical issues preventing access after reasonable troubleshooting  
- Other consumer rights claims where applicable  

Approved refunds are issued **through Lemon Squeezy** to the original payment method.

---

## 6) Chargebacks

Please contact [support@goalverse.app](mailto:support@goalverse.app) **before raising a dispute**—we resolve most issues quickly.  
**Unfounded chargebacks** may result in account suspension to prevent abuse.

---

## 7) Changes to pricing

We provide **at least 30 days’ notice** to active subscribers before price changes take effect on renewal.  
If you do not agree with the new price, **cancel before the renewal date**.

---

## 8) Account access after cancellation or refund

- **Cancellation (no refund):** Premium access continues until the paid period ends; afterwards, access reverts to the **free tier**  
- **Refund granted:** Premium access may be **removed immediately**; you can continue using the **free tier**

---

## 9) Jurisdiction & consumer rights

This policy is governed by the laws of **England and Wales**.  
**EU consumers** retain any non-waivable local rights.  

All payments and refunds remain subject to the [Lemon Squeezy Buyer Terms](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/buyer-terms).
